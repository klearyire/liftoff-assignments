# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will be a golf course tracker first off. I will have it linked up to a MySQL database on my pc, but hope to include a text file to simulate a db 
for proof of concept. This app will include: a date picker, GoogleMaps API, and Weather Service API. Choose a golf course, and a date, and it should return
a map plus a weather forecast for the chosen day. This app will also include authorization and authentication, requiring user Id's and email addresses.

Those are the easy parts.

The following is for the future, and most likely well outside of the scope of this class:
The challenge is that I want to be able to have 2 different users select days, golf courses, and time windows of a few hours. If the two users have overlapping
choices the app should automatically email them with the pertinent information.

This app should solve the problem of the single golfer. For those who don't play, it is nearly impossible to get a tee time (a guaranteed "reservation" 
to play) as a single person. Golf courses will only guarantee times for two - four players. This app will allow multiple single golfers to reserve tee times
when choices match up.

### Features
User login and authentication. Users should be able to log choices.
Date and Time picker. Users should be able to choose a day and a time window of a few hours.
Google maps and weather API. Chosen golf courses should return maps and weather forcast for the date/zip code.
Simulated database functionality. Golf courses should be searchable by location or name.
Simulated server functionality. (How to auto-email users?)

### Technologies
C#, MySQL, unknown others.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I've never created a date or time picker, have limited experience with API's, and have absolutely no clue how to simulate a server.
