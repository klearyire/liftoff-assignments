# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will be a golf course tracker first off. I will have it linked up to a MySQL database on my pc, but hope to include a text file to simulate a db 
for proof of concept. This app will include: GoogleMaps API, and hopefully Weather Service API. Search or choose a golf course and it should return
a map plus a current weather forecast. This app will also include authorization and authentication, requiring user Id's and email addresses.

### Features
User login and authentication. Anonymous can view the course lists and maps, but you must be logged in an authorized to add or remove courses.
Google maps and weather API. Chosen golf courses should return maps and weather forcast.
Simulated database functionality. Golf courses should be searchable by location or name.

### Technologies
C#, MySQL, unknown others.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I've never used API's. While I have some experience with databases it is very limited, and I'll have to learn how to dynamically update
web pages from the database itself without any hard-coding of information.
